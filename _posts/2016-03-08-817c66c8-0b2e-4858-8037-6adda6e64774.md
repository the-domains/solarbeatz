It was a tough year on the playa with plenty of setbacks due to weather and changes to our ever evolving support team, making the completion and execution of our new artistic design not only a great challenge but also a terrific learning experience in collaboration and communication.

Despite the extra effort and frustration the founding members of SolarBeatz are heralding this year's on playa exercise a great success in furthering the functionality of the technical/artist components and forging relationships that will ensure an impactful future for their creation.

Enjoy some of the sights from 2015!  (Sounds coming soon on https://soundcloud.com/solarbeatz)
